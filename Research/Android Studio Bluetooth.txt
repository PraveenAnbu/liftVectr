low power requirements? --> BLE; arduino and Seeed supports both BLE and classic
bluetooh_admin to start device discoverty or manipulate bluetooth settings

Find: new parings, validate connection, transfer data securely, 

BLE basics
1. To setup comms b/n BLE devices, declare permissions in manifest file; source: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/permissions
	a. Looking for B devices --> bluetooth_scan perms
	b. Makes current device discoverable to other B devices --> bluetooth_advertise
	c. If comms w/ already-paired B devices --> bluetooth_connect
	d. These are runtime perms; must request user approval in app before B communication
	e. Can add android:usesPermissionFlags to Bluetooth_scan and set value to neverForLocation (if physical location is never used)
		i. If location isn’t needed, remove ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION perms on app manifest
2. Access the Bluetooth adapter and determine if Bluetooth is available on device; source: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/setup
	a. After pems are in place, use Bluetooth adapter (reps the device’s own B adapter)
		i. Only on B adapter per system; call getDefaultAdapter() to get
		ii. Check whether B is enabled, if it’s not startActivityForResult(); prompts a dialog to appear requesting B to be enabled
3. If available, scan for nearby BLE devices; source: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/find-ble-devices
4. Once device is found, connect to the GATT server on BLE device; source: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/connect-gatt-server
5. After connection made, data can be transferred w/ connected device; source: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/transfer-ble-data
