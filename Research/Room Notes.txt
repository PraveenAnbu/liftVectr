Notes on Local Storage with Room in Android Studio

•	Room provides an abstraction layer of SQLite to allow fluent database access 

Primary Components:
•	Database Class – holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to app’s persisted data
•	Data Entities – represent tables in app’s database
•	Data Access Objects (DAOs) - provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database


•	Data Entities are essentially objects/structs. Each instance of an entity is stored in a table in the app’s database
•	DAOs serve as methods to interact with the data entities in the table
•	Databases are defined with an entities array that lists all of the data entities associated with the database. These serve as the app’s main access point to the persisted data
