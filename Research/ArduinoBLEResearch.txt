Notes:
Structure - Peripheral Device (server) broadcasts Services, which contain Characteristics, to Central Devices (clients). Services are groups of Characteristics, which are individual data points. An example for our liftVectr application would be Service (Accelerometer): Characteristic (X) = Value1, Characteristic (Y) = Value2, Characteristic (Z) = Value3.
Functions - read() for central device to read characteristcis from peripheral device
            write() for peripheral or central device (based on readability and writiability rules) to modify characteristic values
            indicate() for peripheral to automatically send updated data to central without notice, and no requirement of confirmation
            notify() for peripheral to automatically send updated to central without notics, with requirement of confirmation
GATT - Layer for writing services/characteristics
Service and Characteristic Name (16-bit/128-bit UUID)
Characteristic Value (512 bytes maximum)
Can combine characteristic values as a set to be output through one characteristic.
UIUDs may need to contain '-' between every 2 digits. (i.e. AT+GATTADDCHAR=UUID128=00-00-00-05-62-7E-47-E5-A3-FC-DD-AB-D9-7A-A9-66)
Use:
#include <ArduinoBLE.h>
